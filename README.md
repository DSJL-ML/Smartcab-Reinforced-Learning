# Smartcab-Reinforced-Learning
Implemented Q-Learning algorithm in self-driving simulation, optimization with learning parameter tuning.

## Summary
Reinforcement learning was applied to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involves modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties. The Q-learning algorithm was implemented on top of the baseline python code provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The result and discussion were provided in [smartcab.html](https://github.com/ljj-ml/Smartcab-Reinforced-Learning/blob/master/smartcab.html).

## Result
Simulation testing runs achieved zero traffic violation and >90% on time destination arrival.

## Software
The Q-learning algorithm implementation code is written in Python 2.7.
